# A Canvas Game with OOP

The code isn't what you'd call neat, and the gameplay isn't perfect, but I like this project. It utilises the power of OOP to create several enemies at once. Enjoy!

### Controls for the game: 

1. Click in direction you wish to aim a projectile. 
2. If an enemy touches you, it's game over. 
3. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible.
